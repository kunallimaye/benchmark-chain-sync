# LSSD Copy Role Defaults
# =============================================================================
# Copies data from a temporary disk (created from golden snapshot) to LSSD RAID.
# This role is only used for LSSD machines where we can't create disk from snapshot.
#
# Uses parallel dd + tar for maximum throughput (~590 MB/s vs ~150 MB/s with rsync):
# - dd + pv: Copies the large mdbx.dat file (5.5TB) with progress monitoring
# - tar: Copies all other files, preserving ownership automatically
# =============================================================================
