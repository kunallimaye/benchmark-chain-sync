# op-node Handlers - DEPRECATED
# =============================================================================
# Service restart logic is now handled inline in tasks/main.yml to properly
# check service state and respect the force_restart variable.
#
# These handlers are kept for backwards compatibility but should not be
# notified. If you see these handlers being called, check tasks/main.yml.
